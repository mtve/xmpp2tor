P2P instant messaging over TOR, available from any jabber client

it's a single user (but multiple clients are ok) jabber server, that
transparently communicates with other such servers.

it's written in perl and requires AnyEvent.

xmpp server is based on in.jabberd from inetdxtra by R. Rawson-Tetley

how-to use:
- plan your tcp ports, or use default 5222 for xmpp and 5221 for tor service
- create tor hidden service with torrc additional configuration like this:
     HiddenServiceDir </path/>
     HiddenServicePort 8221 <tor_service_addr>:<tor_service_port>
- edit xmpp2tor.conf parameters tor_socks_port, tor_service_name
- run the program like this:
     ./xmpp2tor.pl xmpp2tor.conf
- connect with your jabber client, usually to 127.0.0.1 with user/pass
- add test contact xaeznmlsmpldjqrq.onion
- please report version of your jabber client and any issues
